# PredictingYelpRating
ML - Regression - Neural Network - tf-idf vectorizer to predict yelp rating based on reviews per buisness

I built a machine learning pipeline to predict Yelp business ratings using only customer reviews. The project involved text preprocessing with TF‑IDF, training regression and neural network models, and evaluating their performance. It demonstrates my ability to apply NLP techniques to real-world data and translate unstructured text into actionable insights.


includes:

            Data preprocessing (cleaning Yelp reviews)

            Text vectorization (TF‑IDF)

            Model training (regression, neural networks)

            Evaluation (accuracy, error metrics)

What It Showcases

    Text Preprocessing & NLP:

        Converting raw text reviews into numerical features using TF‑IDF.

        Demonstrates understanding of feature extraction from unstructured data.

    Machine Learning Modeling:

        Regression models to predict continuous ratings.

        Neural networks for capturing nonlinear relationships in text features.

    Applied Sentiment Analysis:

        Shows how review text can be leveraged to infer business quality.

        Bridges the gap between subjective language and quantitative ratings.
